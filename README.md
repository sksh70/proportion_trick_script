# proportion_trick_script
### Info
This script will automatically align the bones so you don't have to spend too much time doing it manually.

### Download
Click on the green Code button then <b>Download ZIP</b> or click on [this link](https://github.com/sksh70/proportion_trick_script/archive/main.zip).

### Requirements
Download Blender 2.79 or 2.9 from: https://download.blender.org/release/</br>

### Notes
I made this for Garry's Mod player models. Idk if it will work on L4D survivors.  
I provided files for Blender 2.79 & 2.9 but use 2.9 if possible.  
There are 2 files for 2.79:
1. proportion_trick_2.7.blend
   - same file used in the video & outdated
2. proportion_trick_2.7_new.blend
   - code similar to 2.9 so the steps are slighly different
   - bones no longer track child bones without constraint
